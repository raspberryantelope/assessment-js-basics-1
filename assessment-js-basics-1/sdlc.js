// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const Analysis of Requirements = "This is the second step,  in which the requirements and expectations of the product are determined."
const Design = "This is the third step, in which the architecture and interface are planned and laid out based on the product requirements."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the various designed elements are turned into code."
const Testing & Integration = "This is the fifth step, in which the elements are put together, tested for bugs and errors, and eventually put into place."
const Maintain "This is the final (and ongoing) step, in which the engineer(s) continue to provide updates and support for the product for an amount of time after the initial release."
